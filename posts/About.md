Hey every,ne! Welcome to my blog.

Looks like you're interested to know more about me. So here you go!

I'm a 21 year old guy trying to make sense of this world and figure out life for myself. I'm constantly thriving to know myself better, get in sync with my nature and intuition. And accordingly shape the reality around me. It's one of the lesser known facts that I've been experiencing. 

However there's a constant battle in my mind about the seemingly diverging idea of - submission to the power of our nature and live according to it vs try to bend reality according to my core nature.
