These are just my random thoughts. There are so man thoughts in my mind. But it's rather surprising that when I sit to write something about them, I lose my words. I fall short of words to express myself. This is most disturbing, given that I read so much. Maybe I'm a bit out of practice haha! But this is exciting! Striving to express myself in an interesting way ;)
